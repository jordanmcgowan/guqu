Since no .exe file can be generated until the program is run, in order to use our application, you will need to download the zip (or clone the git repo - your choice). The user will also need to have Visual Studio installed as we are running the application within the VS software right now. Once VS is installed open the project via:
Open VS <br/>
Click “Open Project”<br/>
Navigate to and open ‘guqu-master’ folder<br/>
Open ‘Guqu’ folder<br/>
Select the Guqu.sln (Visual Studio solution) file<br/>
Click  “Start” and the dependencies should install, and the application should launch <br/>


To use Guqu, follow these steps:<br/>

Click “Create New Account”on the dialog box that appears<br/>
Create an account<br/>
Password must be at least 8 characters<br/>
Click “Create Account”<br/>
Add Cloud Account<br/>
Please select Google Drive as it is the most stable cloud service at this point<br/>
Sign into Google Drive<br/>
If you are not prompted to enter your credentials, you are most likely already signed into Google Drive on that computer, so your authorization is complete.<br/>
Click “Allow” on Google Drive authentication page<br/>
Close browser<br/>
The main window of our application should open, but it will be blank.<br/>
If the application crashes, restart the app, logging in with the same credentials<br/>
One the main window appears:<br/>
Click “Edit”<br/>
Click “Manage Accounts”<br/>
Click “Add Account”<br/>
Select Google Drive and proceed to login<br/>
If an additional main view appears, please close it. Yes, we know this is an issue and we are working on it. <br/>
Click “Download” <br/>
Select a file path<br/>
Ensure you have admin access to that file path (no network drives)<br/>
Click Ok<br/>
Wait for the left bar to populate with ‘Google Drive’ (~20 seconds)<br/>
All of your drive files and folders should be shown in a nested hierarchy<br/>
