Since no .exe file can be generated until the program is run, in order to use our application, you will need to download the zip (or clone the git repo - your choice). The user will also <strong>need to have Visual Studio installed </strong> as we are running the application within the VS software right now. Once VS is installed open the project via: <br/>
-Open VS <br/>
-Click “Open Project”<br/>
-Navigate to and open ‘guqu-master’ folder<br/>
-Open ‘Guqu’ folder<br/>
-Select the Guqu.sln (Visual Studio solution) file<br/>
-Click  “Start” - the dependencies should install, and the application should launch <br/>


To use Guqu, follow these steps:<br/>
